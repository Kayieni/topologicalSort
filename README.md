Topological Sort In 4 Families

Implementation of Kahn's topological sort algorithm in the following families and programming languages:

Functional - Lisp, run with clisp
Procedural - C, run with gcc
Object-Oriented - Java, run with javac 
Logical - Prolog, run with SWI-Prolog

These programs serve as an exploration of four distinctive approaches to solving problems with code. Conceptual mastery of the families of programming languages allows me to choose the right tool to elegantly solve the problem at hand on an development project. Slinging code in each of these diametrically different languages in the span of a few months has reinforced my ability to quickly pick up and utilize a new language and development environment.
